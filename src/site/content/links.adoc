Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

This section contains libraries of components that can be imported into
Logisim. If you have your own library of components that you think would
be useful to others, I'll be happy to post a link here to a hosting Web
site or to the library itself.

link:download/7400-lib.zip[7400 series Logisim library from Ben Oztalay]
(link:download/7400-lib.zip[ZIP],
link:download/7400-lib.circ[uncompressed])

A set of Logisim circuits corresponding to a large number of 7400-series
chips, produced by Ben Oztalay. The pin layout matches the 7400 IC
layouts. (2011, released into public domain).

link:download/7400-series-rev1.zip[7400 series Logisim library from
Technological Services Company]
(link:download/7400-series-rev1.zip[ZIP],
link:download/7400-series-rev1.circ[uncompressed])

A set of Logisim circuits corresponding to a large number of 7400-series
chips, produced by Technological Services Company. The pin layout has
inputs on the left, outputs on the right. (Copyright 2005, released
under the GPL).

link:download/gray-1.0.jar[Gray Counter example] (JAR)

The JAR library described in the _Logisim User's Guide_ for version
2.3.0 and later.

link:download/incr-1.1.jar[Incrementer example] (JAR)

The outdated JAR library described in the _Logisim User's Guide_ prior
to version 2.3.0. Compatible with versions Logisim 2.0 Beta 20 and
later. The class name is `com.cburch.incr.Components`.

Free graphical tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My hope is that some day some other software developers out there will
create something that in my view renders Logisim irrelevant. So I
occasionally browse the competition to see whether that day has come.
Here's a list of links, and you can judge for yourself.

* http://www.spsu.edu/cs/faculty/bbrown/circuits/howto.html[Digital
Works 2.0] is Windows freeware. It is a fairly complete package, but it
is no longer under development. I no longer know where one can download
a copy. _18 Jul 2007_.
*
http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/webdemos/index.html[HADES]
is a Java-based tool, which is available at no cost but does not appear
to be open-source. The simulation and library functionality is quite
extensive, but the interface is on the awkward side. _18 Jul 2007_
* http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~pop/jlsp/bin/JLS.html[JLS] is a Java-based tool
that is available at no cost from the author but is not open-source or
freeware. It doesn't simulate circuits as you build them, but its
simulation capabilities are more extensive than Logisim's. _18 Jul 2007_
* link:index.html[Logisim] is an open source Java tool. Of course, I
think it's the best choice. _18 Jul 2007_
* http://www.softronix.com/logic.html[MultiMedia Logic] is open source
Windows software; It doesn't seem to support hierarchical circuits or
wire bundling, so it's quite limited as far as designing CPU-scale
circuits, but it does provide a fun set of I/O components. _18 Jul 2007_
* http://www.tkgate.org/index.html[TkGate] is open source software. It's
probably the most legitimate no-cost competitor to Logisim: It's
simulation facilities seem quite sound, though the interface strikes me
as rather awkward. It requires tcl/tk to run; it can run on Windows if
you have Cygwin installed. _18 Jul 2007_
* http://math.hws.edu/TMCM/java/xLogicCircuits/[xLogicCircuits] is my
favorite among the bare-bones Java applets. It has some utility if
you're spending one or two weeks introducing students to the subject.
_18 Jul 2007_
* Other alternatives I have investigated, but which don't yet seem have
much to recommend them:
** http://www.a-rostin.de/klogic/[KLogic], open source Linux
** http://www.tetzl.de/java_logic_simulator.html[LogicSim], open source
Java
** http://web.mit.edu/ara/www/ds.html[Digital Simulator], closed source
shareware, free for education

You might also find my more exhaustive link:links-2002.html[outdated
list] useful. Maybe.

Commercial graphical tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* http://www.matrixmultimedia.com[Digital Works 3.0] is a commercial
Windows product; I have not tried it, but presumably it is more thorough
than Digital Works 2.0, which was already good. It does not seem to be
under active development. _18 Jul 2007_
* http://www.logicworks5.com[LogicWorks] is a Windows-specific
commercial product also, but it seems more likely to receive continuing
support. I have not tried it, but it seems like a thorough system. It
includes some support for incorporating VHDL specifications. _18 Jul
2007_
* Others:
** http://www.research-systems.com/easysim/easysim.htm[EasySim],
commercial Windows
** http://home.arcor.de/khloch/locad/index.htm[LOCAD], commercial(?)
Windows, in German

Text-based tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog/[Icarus Verilog], the dominant
open-source Verilog compiler
* Others:
** http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~elm/Software/Esim/[esim], source available
but license unclear, uses custom language
** http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/logicsim/[Iowa Logic Specification
Language], open source, uses custom language
** https://sourceforge.net/projects/veriwell/[VeriWell], open source,
uses Verilog
